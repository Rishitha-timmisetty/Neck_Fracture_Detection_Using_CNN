<h1 align="center">neck Spine Fracture Detection Using CNN</h1>

<p align="center">
  Developed CNN model for rapid neck fracture detection using CT scans, ensuring swift and accurate diagnosis for improved medical intervention.
</p>

## Overview

- The project centers on the detection of neck spine fractures.
- A CNN-based model is employed for automated diagnosis.
- CT scans are the primary imaging modality used for fracture detection.

## Motivation

- Prompt identification of neck fractures is crucial for timely medical intervention.
- Neck pain is often underestimated and disregarded, leading to delayed diagnosis.
- Unstable patients require immediate observation and treatment to prevent further complications.

## Objectives

- Detect various types of neck fractures, including flexion, flexion-rotation, extension, extension-rotation, vertical compression, lateral flexion, odontoid fractures, and atlanto-occipital dislocation.
- Identify the specific vertebrae affected by fractures, if applicable.
- Develop and train a CNN model to automate fracture detection.
- Accelerate diagnosis for faster medical intervention.

## Scope

- The model is designed exclusively for the neck region of the spine (C1 to C7 vertebrae).
- CT scans are the primary imaging source for diagnosis.
- The model can potentially identify fractures, accurately.

## Advantages

- Swift and accurate fracture detection in the neck spine.
- Faster diagnosis compared to manual methods.
- Benefits unstable patients by expediting surgical procedures.

## Applications

- Valuable in robotic analysis and surgical interventions.
- Helps distinguish between common neck pain and neck fractures.
- Useful for immediate diagnosis following accidents and neck injuries.
